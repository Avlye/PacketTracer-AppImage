An automated tool for building appimages with [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage) for Packet Tracer. 

This repo is a fork from [Diolinux/PacketTracer-AppImage](https://github.com/Diolinux/PacketTracer-AppImage).

# Latest Release

## Motivations

Would be ideal having an automated build release for Cisco Packet Tracer, so you can always get the latest release.
Thinking about that, I decided to create this repo as an opinionated tool for building app images.
